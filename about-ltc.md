# About Love-to-Code

Love-to-Code is a new kind of crafting supply available from Chibitronics.  It is designed to make it easy to program and even easier to deploy.  It uses a low-power microcontroller much like that provided by Arduino.  The key difference is that it is programmed via audio, which means it can be programmed using a standard laptop or mobile phone.
